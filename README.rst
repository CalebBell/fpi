What is fpi?
------------

fpi is open-source software for engineers and technicians working in the
fields of chemical or mechanical engineering. It includes modules
for various fluid-particle interaction calculations..

The fpi library depends on the SciPy library to provide numerical constants,
interpolation, integration, and numerical solving functionality. fpi runs on
all operating systems which support Python, is quick to install, and is free
of charge. fpi is designed to be easy to use while still providing powerful
functionality. If you need to perform some fpi calculations, give
fpi a try.
